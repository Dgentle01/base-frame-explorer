# üõ†Ô∏è What You Are Building <br>
We are building a Mini Farcaster Frame ‚Äî a compact, powerful, and shareable web app embedded within the Farcaster ecosystem ‚Äî that:

## üéØ Key Features: <br>

<li> Displays trending Zora NFTs </li>
<li> Lists newly minted NFTs </li>
<li> Ranks NFTs by market cap and trading volume </li>
<li> Provides live NFT search by name or artist, with filters </li>
<li> Enables direct minting of NFTs on the Ethereum Base network </li>
<li> Includes wallet connection via RainbowKit/Web3Modal </li>
<li> Uses animated, interactive NFT cards </li>
<li> Allows list/grid view toggling </li>
<li> Integrates seamlessly with Farcaster, letting people share and engage with NFTs natively inside the app via Frames </li> <br>

!| <b> It combines Web3 discovery, market insights, minting actions, and social sharing all in one sleek, optimized mini app. </b>

## üí° The Problem This Project Solves
‚úÖ Problem 1: NFT Discovery is Fragmented
Users struggle to find trending, high-value, or fresh NFTs without jumping between platforms (Zora, OpenSea, Twitter, etc.).

This project aggregates and curates these in one place, making discovery seamless.

‚úÖ Problem 2: NFT Minting UX is Clunky
Minting NFTs often requires jumping to different pages, connecting wallets manually, and figuring out contract interactions.

This projet provides one-click minting from a sleek interface, powered by RainbowKit and Base network.

‚úÖ Problem 3: NFT Sharing Lacks Context and Interactivity
Sharing NFTs on social platforms doesn‚Äôt always give rich previews or interactivity.

Farcaster Frames solve this ‚Äî and we‚Äôre building a Frame-native interface that‚Äôs designed to look beautiful in a post, load fast, and let users interact instantly.

‚úÖ Problem 4: No Unified Place to Track Volume & Cap
Many platforms show trends but not real-time trading metrics (volume, cap).

This project provides that insight layer, so users can make better decisions on what to mint or follow.

‚úÖ Problem 5: Base Network Needs Showcases
The Ethereum Base network is fast and low-cost, but it lacks showcase-ready apps that feel modern and crypto-native.

YWe‚Äôre giving Base a flagship-worthy dApp that‚Äôs perfect for onboarding creators and collectors.

## üöÄ Summary
We‚Äôre building a Web3-native discovery + action platform that:

<li> Surfaces the best NFTs (insight + discovery) </li>

<li> Makes it easy to mint (action) </li>

<li> Lets users share them with built-in engagement (distribution via Farcaster) </li>


<b> It's sleek, fast, and designed to fit naturally into the emerging onchain social and Base NFT ecosystem. </b>
