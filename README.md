# 🛠️ What You Are Building <br>
We are building a Mini Farcaster Frame — a compact, powerful, and shareable web app embedded within the Farcaster ecosystem — that:

## 🎯 Key Features:
Displays trending Zora NFTs

Lists newly minted NFTs
Ranks NFTs by market cap and trading volume
Provides live NFT search by name or artist, with filters
Enables direct minting of NFTs on the Ethereum Base network
Includes wallet connection via RainbowKit/Web3Modal
Uses animated, interactive NFT cards
Allows list/grid view toggling
Integrates seamlessly with Farcaster, letting people share and engage with NFTs natively inside the app via Frames

It combines Web3 discovery, market insights, minting actions, and social sharing all in one sleek, optimized mini app.
